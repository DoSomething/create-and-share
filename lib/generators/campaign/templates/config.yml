home:
  # Put homepage configuration here.  This follows
  # the same principal as "filters", except for
  # "constraints".  e.g.:
  #
  # order:
  #   - "COUNT(votes.id) ASC"
  #   - "created_at DESC"
  # where:
  #   "state": "NY"

filters:
  # Put your filters here, e.g.:
  # ":state":
  #   constraints:
  #     ":state": "(?<state>[A-Z]{2})"
  #   where:
  #     "state": "state"

popups:
  # Put your popups here, e.g.:
  # 5: "test"

stats:
  # Put potential stats here.  These will mix in the
  # infinite scroll.  You'll need to define stat_frequency
  # for your campaign for this to show up.  e.g.:
  # - "Cats don't like water"
  # - "Giraffes are tall"
